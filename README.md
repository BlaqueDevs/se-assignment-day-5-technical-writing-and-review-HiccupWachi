Regular folks;Step by step guidance and practical applications,
3.For Tech experts;Use of data heavy charts and diagrams. Regular folks;use visuals,storytelling and real world examples they relate to.

5.Test out technical content with a diverse group and gatther feedback on what was clear and what needs further specification.
6.During presentations note where people ask the most questions -those areas likely need simplification.
7.Using the teach back approch and if they struggle ,simplify further your explanation.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
Replacing technical terms with simple everyday language and if jargons are necessary,a simple definition will surfice.
Familiarizing complex concepts to relatable situations that the audience can grasp.
Breaking information into small absorvable chunks;short paragraphs and bullet points for readability.
Use visual aids replacing text-heavy explanations with flowcharts,step by step guide images and icons.
Providing step by step instructions using action based languages.
Allowing the audience to choose between beginner friendly guides and advanced documentation.
Having someone with limited technical knowledge rewiew the content.

-Visuals allow for breakdown of information,this prevents overwhelming the readers/audiences.

## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
